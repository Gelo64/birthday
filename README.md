Happy birthday to you lhean


"Today is as beautiful as other days, but you realize another year has gone in the blink of the eyes. However, do you know? Today is just special, so special to you. That's why let's make it the best celebration ever and let me share a piece of happiness with you. I made all this as a birthday present to you. Thanks for being there, thanks for the friendship we made, thanks for everything. 

I wish you all the best. May your life be at ease, and may all your wishes come true. Remember your ambitions you live as a free bird, flying in the blue sky. Now things are different. The real story of your life is just about to begin. Indeed, but don't worry because God has your back, and this year will be better. I hope you'll find happiness along the way. 

Keep your spirit up, enjoy every single moment that you experience today, fill it with your most beautiful smile, and make it the best memory. Lastly, I'd like to wish you one more time..."
